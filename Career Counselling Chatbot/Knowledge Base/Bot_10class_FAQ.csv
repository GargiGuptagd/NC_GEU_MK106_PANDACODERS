How do I deal with exam related stress? ,"Recognize your negative thoughts. Once you closely examine these thoughts you'll see how unrealistic they are. Challenge the thoughts that say you are a failure and that you can't succeed. Remind yourself that it was just another exam and with effort, you will do better in your next attempt."
What if I do badly? ,Replace self-criticism with self-correction. Judging yourself harshly now won't help you do better in the future. Take the position of an observer. What if a good friend told you he had failed? Would you call him a failure? Most probably you would emphasize his good points and help him put the situation in perspective. 
How do I deal with my family's disappointment if my results are not good? ,"Be open and honest with them. Share what you feel about the result and what you think went wrong. Reassure them of your concern and efforts. Above all, do not have a negative bias against your parents because sometimes they need more reassuring than you do. "
What if I don't get the marks I'm expecting? ,"Concentrate on your achievements and be realistic about your expectations as well. Usually we know when we have made a mistake, so take these into account while drawing up expected marks. If you are still dissatisfied with the results, the option of rechecking is always open. "
How can I inculcate positive attitude towards future when I feel so scared? ,"Don’t keep on thinking about the future.
Believe in yourself.
Try to put your best effort.
Learn from your previous experiences papers and work more on your weak areas.
Always remember that no one can see the future but what you can do is, prepare best for tomorrow. "
